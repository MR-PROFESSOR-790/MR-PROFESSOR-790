# 👋 Greetings, Intruder! I’m @MR-PROFESSOR-790 👨‍💻

Welcome to the control center of chaos, code, and cybersecurity sorcery.  
I’m **Muhammad Mazhar Saeed**, but in the dark halls of cyberspace, I’m known as **PROFESSOR** —  
🧠 a **Red Team Strategist**, 🛡️ **Cyber Security Artisan**, and 🤖 **AI Whisperer**.  
I don’t just debug code... I interrogate it.

---

## 🧭 My Mission:
> _Break the unbreakable. Automate the undetectable.  
> Weaponize intelligence. Craft digital art in exploits._

---

## 👀 Interests (Where I unleash my curiosity):
- 🔐 **Offensive Security & Red Team Ops** — infiltrating systems for the greater good
- 🧠 **AI/ML for Payload Generation** — bending models to think like hackers
- 🕷️ **Web App Pentesting** — XSS, CSRF, RCE, SQLi? I breathe those acronyms
- ⛓️ **Blockchain & Smart Contract**
- 🤯 **AI-Powered Cyber Tools for Auto Exploitation**
- 🧨 **CTF Wizardry** — exploiting logic, bypassing filters, cracking flags

---

## 🌱 Currently Brewing Knowledge Potions In:
- 🧬 Fine-tuning LLMs for intelligent payload generation
- 🔩 Building an **EVM simulator** in C++ from scratch with gas metering
- 🏗️ Reverse-engineering assembly (MASM) like it's poetry
- ⚙️ REST APIs secured like Fort Knox using Django
- 🧠 Merging networking with decentralized architectures

---

## 🤝 Seeking Allies For:
- 🔭 Security-focused Open Source AI Tools
- 🎯 Red Team Simulators & Payload Automation Frameworks
- 🚨 Projects pushing the boundaries of ethical hacking
- 🌐 Blockchain-secure File Transfer Protocols
- 🧠 AI-driven tools for solving next-gen CTFs

## 😄 Pronouns:
**He / Him / Professor**

## ⚡ Cyber Fact:
> One of my payloads got flagged by a WAF,  
> not because it was malicious…  
> but because it was **too elegant**.  
>  
> I don’t `alert('XSS')` — I **rewrite DOM realities**.

---

## 💻 Featured Projects:
- 🚀 **XSS Payload Generator (ML-Based)**  
  > A model trained to output XSS vectors like a blackhat poet.

- 🧠 **AI-Powered CTF Solver**  
  > Think Sherlock Holmes, but it speaks Python and JavaScript.

- 🧬 **EVM to RISCV Transpiler**  
  > Because smart contracts deserve low-level power too.

- 📊 **Graph Visualizer (C++ / Qt)**  
  > Turn DFS and BFS into an animated cyberpunk storyboard.

- 🔐 **Secure GDrive 2.0 (IPFS + Ethereum)**  
  > Decentralized. Encrypted. Yours only. Not even Big Brother gets in.
